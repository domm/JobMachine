TODO
- Finish client methods check and receive (9.0)
  The payload of the result notification includes the result_id. fetch result using that id.
- Pg
  How do you instruct "listen" to never return (no timeout)?
  Does 9.0 have a native JSON type? (Parameters, result)
- More fine grained Worker status methods, 
  finished,failed,failure (total), declined (or wait)
- tests, incl database, test for installed pg
- tasks/jobs with expiration (defaulting to never)
- locked flag / next try datetime
- Wait until datetime (run_after)
- Housekeeping section (upon loop timeout)
  - remove dead tasks
  - Find and recycle locked tasks (left by dead processes etc)
  - config option (or similar) to determine if chores can be processed in a loop
- Logging
  - To stderr or syslog? If syslog (or log4perl), DB carp -> log
  - When a task is transferred to process
  - When do_chores does chores, removing old tasks, failing tasks
- Task dependency / task bundling
- Scoreboard / status monitoring
- Job Administration
- Schedule table, ideas
  - cron-like?
  - or perhaps DateTime recurring thingie
