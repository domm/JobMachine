	Ripped out Net::Stomp and put in PostgreSQL's notify/listen construct
	instead.
	Added a sql file to create jobmachine schema and tables.
	Made somewhat usable tests, at least for client. We need to have a
	'test' database with the correct tables in the jobmachine schema. Need
	to fix that at some point.
